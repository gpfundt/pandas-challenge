# pandas-challenge

in this project I used the Pandas library to analyze school district data.

From the CSVs containing district standardized test results as well as every student's math/reading scores and various information on the schools they attend. I first had to aggregate the data in order to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

I am able to determine the following:

**District Summary**
Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  -Total Schools
  -Total Students
  -Total Budget
  -Average Math Score
  -Average Reading Score
  -% Passing Math
  -% Passing Reading
  -Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**School Summary**
Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  -School Name
  -School Type
  -Total Students
  -Total School Budget
  -Per Student Budget
  -Average Math Score
  -Average Reading Score
  -% Passing Math
  -% Passing Reading
  -Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**

**Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**
 
**Math Scores by Grade**
 
**Reading Scores by Grade**

**Scores by School Spending** -School performance break down based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). 
 
**Scores by School Size** -School performance break down based on school size. 
  
**Scores by School Type** -School performance break down based on school type Charter vs. District).
