# pandas-challenge

in this project I used the Pandas library to analyze school district data.

From the CSVs containing district standardized test results as well as every student's math/reading scores and various information on the schools they attend I determine the following:

District Summary
Metrics include:
  -Total Schools
  -Total Students
  -Total Budget
  -Average Math Score
  -Average Reading Score
  -% Passing Math
  -% Passing Reading
  -Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

School Summary
Metrics include:
  -School Name
  -School Type
  -Total Students
  -Total School Budget
  -Per Student Budget
  -Average Math Score
  -Average Reading Score
  -% Passing Math
  -% Passing Reading
  -Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)
  
Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
Math Scores by Grade
Reading Scores by Grade
Scores by School Spending -School performance break down based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). 
Scores by School Size -School performance break down based on school size. 
Scores by School Type -School performance break down based on school type Charter vs. District).
